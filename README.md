### Set up a Para Developer Portal Account and Configure Native Passkeys
To get an API Key and configure your team and bundle ids, please go to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.getpara.com/).

Once you've created an API key, please fill out the "Native Passkey Configuration" Section with your App Info described above. Please note that once entered, this information can take up to a day to be reflected by Apple. Ping us if you have any questions or if you would like to check in on the status of this

## Installation

  

### Swift Package Manager

  

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

  

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding ParaSwift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.

  

```swift

dependencies: [

.package(url: "https://github.com/getpara/swift-sdk.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))

]

```

  

Normally you'll want to depend on the `ParaSwift` target:

  

```swift

.product(name: "ParaSwift", package: "ParaSwift")

```

  

## Configuring You Project

  

ParaSwift utilizes native passkeys for authentication and wallet information. In order to use native passkeys in your app you will need several things

  

### Associated Domains



Under **Targets**->**AppName**->**Signing & Capabilities**, click on the **+Capability** button.

<img width="1483" alt="Capability" src="https://github.com/capsule-org/swift-sdk/assets/4346395/296ade64-552a-4833-9d24-4059335e82d2">

From the prompt that appears, search for and select **Associated Domains**

<img width="702" alt="Associated Domains" src="https://github.com/capsule-org/swift-sdk/assets/4346395/6570acd4-75a6-43d2-92cc-2da713a51246">


> **Note:** In order to add the associated domains capability to your project, you cannot use a personal team for the purposes of signing. If you are, you need to set up a company team with Apple.

In the associated domains section that appears after adding it, you will need to add two domains

1. webcredentials:app.beta.usecapsule.com
2. webcredentials:app.usecapsule.com

<img width="874" alt="Add Associated Domains" src="https://github.com/capsule-org/swift-sdk/assets/4346395/84c010e3-1377-4be4-ba74-6644781d78a4">
<img width="370" alt="AD Filled Out" src="https://github.com/capsule-org/swift-sdk/assets/4346395/3fb7a653-b90d-47b3-ae05-dd75905d3458">


This will allow you to use passkeys that have been created on any app that uses the Capsule system, so if your users already have a Capsule wallet they will be able to use it in your app.  


### Env File

In order to set your API Key and desired environment in the example app, please copy the file locations at Configs/example into the root level of your project and name it EnvDebug for development, and EnvRelease for production. This is only an example of how to manage your environment variables.

## Using ParaSwift

  

### Introduction

  

ParaSwift provides an interface to Capsule services from within iOS applications using SwiftUI (Support for UIKit coming soon).

  

### Configuring

  

To configure the capsule instance, you will need to create an instance of the capsule object as well as the globally available authorizationController environment object. This will be needed in several functions later on. If you need an API Key, please reach out to the Capsule Team.

  

### Creating a User

  

To create a user, you should first check in the provided email address exists, and if it does not then create it

  

```swift

Button("Sign Up") {

Task.init {

let userExists = try! await paraManager.checkIfUserExists(email: email)

if userExists {

return

}

try! await paraManager.createUser(email: email)

...

}

}

```

  

Upon success, the user should receive an email with a 6 digit verification pin. Call the verify function with the verification code acquired from this step. This will return a biometricsId which will be necessary to pass to the next function, generatePasskey.

  

Generate passkey takes in the authorizationController that was set up earlier. This is necessary to be able to allow the application to present the Passkey modals for creating and selecting a Passkey.

  

After generating the passkey, the last step is to create a wallet.

  

```swift

Button("Verify") {

Task.init {

let biometricsId = try! await paraManager.verify(verificationCode: code)

try! await paraManager.generatePasskey(email: email, biometricsId: biometricsId, authorizationController: authorizationController)

try! await paraManager.createWallet(skipDistributable: false)

}

}

```

  

After the wallet has been created, it will be set in the ParaManager object as a Published var.

  

### Signing a Message

  

To sign a message, all you need to do is pass in the id of the wallet you would like to use which can be obtained from the paraManager.wallet property, and the text that you would like to sign. This will produce a messageSignature.

  

```swift

Button("Sign Message") {

Task.init {

let messageSignature = try! await paraManager.signMessage(walletId: wallet.id, message: "Some message to sign")

...

}

}

```

## EVM Signer

You may also use the evm signer to sign messages, sign transactions, and send transactions

### Instantiating the signer

To start, you must instantiate the signer with your preferred JsonRPCProvider URL. For this example, we are using Infura Sepolia and the first wallet in the paraManager. The wallet is optional, and can be selected / changed after instantiation.

```swift
let paraEvmSigner = try! ParaEvmSigner(paraManager: paraManager, rpcUrl: "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_API_KEY>", walletId: paraManager.wallets.first!.id)
```

### Select a Wallet

```swift
try! await paraEvmSigner.selectWallet(walletId: paraManager.wallets.first!.id)
```

### Signing a Message

```swift
let message = "Hello, World!"
let signature = try! await paraEvmSigner.signMessage(message)
print(signature)
```

### Signing a Transaction

To sign a transaction, you must first JSONEncode the transaction object, and then b64Encode the resulting data to get the base64 encoded string. This is what needs to be passed to the paraEvmSigner signTransaction function.

```swift
let transaction = Transaction(<TX_PARAMS>)
let encodedTransaction = try! JSONEncoder().encode(transaction)
let b64EncodedTransaction = encodedTransaction.base64EncodedString()
let signature = try! await paraEvmSigner.signTransaction(b64EncodedTransaction)
print(signature)
```

### Sending a Transaction

To send a transaction, you must first JSONEncode the transaction object, and then b64Encode the resulting data to get the base64 encoded string. This is what needs to be passed to the paraEvmSigner sendTransaction function.

```swift
let transaction = Transaction(<TX_PARAMS>)
let encodedTransaction = try! JSONEncoder().encode(transaction)
let b64EncodedTransaction = encodedTransaction.base64EncodedString()
let signedTx = try! await paraEvmSigner.sendTransaction(b64EncodedTransaction)
print(signedTx)
```
